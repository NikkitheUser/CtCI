/*
we are gonna use a case that has 2 non-parallel and 2 non vertical lines

we can start by figuring out the y intercept and the slopes of the lines

then we can see where they intersect and if they do intersect.

how do we do the first part?
we can do y=mx+b
so we can do
y=4x+1 and y=3x+2 
with this we can see if the math will give us the intersection when we move the x around.
