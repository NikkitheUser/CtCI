/*
shallow vs deep copy
deep copies can copy all member alues from one object to another, along with pointers.
shallow copies can do this too, but it cant work with pointers.

we use shallow copies to quickly move objects around without actually needing to do complicated duplications.
deep copies are used for more complex movements, and are used more often than shallow copies.
