chess test:
with a program like this, we can stress test it to see how it handles improbable issues:
-no pieces on the board
-the board is full of pieces
-we ask it to move a piece to the negatives
-have either more or less white pieces than black pieces
- delete a piece while moves
-use strings instead of ints
