how to test a pen:
who is the pen for?
what kind of pen is it?
what type of material is the pen supposed to write on?
can the pen ink be removed? if so with what?
does it come in one sigular color or more?

we then try to see how well it does its intedned purpose.
we write on the material that the pen is supposed to be good at wrtiting on.
we test each color to see how long it takes for the ink to run out and how legiable it is on the material.
we then see if the pen can be washed out of the material, and which colors remove easier.
