no test tools:

without using testing tools, we can test a webpage in various ways:
-response time, we want to test the webpage on multiple devices. this allows us to see if, for example, the desktop version works fine but theres an issue with the mobile page
-user acess, besides the people who worked on the webpage, can others zacess it? if the page was made in califronia, is there any issues if someone from maryland loads it?
