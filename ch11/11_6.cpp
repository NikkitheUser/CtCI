test an atm:
-besides the "general public", who else is intended to use this? users in wheelchairs, hearing impaired, blind folks?
-what can the atm do? can it check you account balance, make withdraws, transactions, can it take in your checks?

we can mess with it first digitally.
-withdraw non-exisitent money
-ask for a non existent account
-make an account name that is all integers, all special characters or blank


then we test for security:
-what happens if you fail to get into an account to many times?
-can the system detect if one account is being acessed at the same time in different locations?
