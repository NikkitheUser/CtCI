object reflection:
this gives us reflective info about classes and objects. this can range from getting a new instance of a class, getting info about methods, and getting/setting object fields directly by getting field reference(racess modifier is not a worry)

this is useful to us since we observe the behavior of our application. Since we can see how it behaves, this makes debuging and testing easier as well.
