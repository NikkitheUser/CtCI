//Hashmap:
//iterates through keys, tho order is arbitrary. uses linked lists

//treemap:
//keys are ordered and can be sorted. 

//LinkHashMap: 
//like a hashmap, with linked lists and pointers pointing to the next pointer

//if we needed to map names for a family tree, we would use a treemap

//if we need to make the ordereing of keys match that of order of inserttion, we use the linkhashmap
