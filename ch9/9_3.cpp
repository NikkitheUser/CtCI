Web Crawler:
how do we design a way to avoid infinite loops?

in the situation of a web crawler, a infinte loop can occur if a cycle occurs during the process. 

one way to do this is to dectect a cycle, this can be done witha hash table. we use this hashtable as a way to see if we entered a web page or not.
