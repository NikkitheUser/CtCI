Cache:
list of assumptions based on this question:
- the quieres we are gonna cache ais gonna be around the millions
- calling will be quick
- besides the processSearch, everything else works as it should without us mentioning it


for a cache to work as intended it needs to remove old data to give way to new data and it has to be good at looking up data as well.

we can do this by using a hash table for the look up portion, and mesh it together with a linked list for the purging data portion.
