Personal Financial Manager:
so lets say that this will:
-connect to your bank, and sort through your fincial history
-allow us to make multiple bank accounts
-and we can see outgoing and incoming transactions, as well as your current balance

we can build a simple database:
we synch the bank data-> send it to a categorizer(split between incoming/outgoing money)-> send it through the "finacial manager"-> then it hits the frontend for the user to see
