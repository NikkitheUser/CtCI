 pair n's factors by their complements. For example, if n is 36, the factors are (1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 12), (4, 9), (6,6). Note that (6, 6) only contributes one factor, thus giving n an odd number of factors.
Question: How many perfect squares are there?
There are 10 perfect squares. You could count them (1 , 4,9, 16, 25, 36,49,64, 81, 100)' or you could simply realize that you can take the numbers 1 through 10 and square them:
11, 22, 33, ... , 1010
Therefore, there are 10 lockers open at the end of this process.
