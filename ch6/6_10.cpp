/*
a binary indicator for poisoned or unpoisoned. Is it possible to map 1000 keys to 10 binary values such that each key is mapped to a unique configuration of values? Yes, of course. This is what a binary number is.
We can take each bottle number and look at its binary representation. If there's a 1 in the ith digit, then we will add a drop of this bottle's contents to test strip i. Observe that 210 is 1024, so 10 test strips will be enough to handle up to 1024 bottles.
We wait seven days, and then read the results. If test strip i is positive, then set bit i of the result value. Reading all the test strips will give us the ID of the poisoned bottle.

int findPoisonedBottle(ArrayList<Bottle> bottles, ArrayList<TestStrip> strips)

void runTests(ArrayList<Bottle> bottles, ArrayList<TestStrip> testStrips) 
{
ArrayList<Integer> getPositiveOnDay(ArrayList<TestStrip> testStrips, int day)
